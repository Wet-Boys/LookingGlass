Fixed issue with scoreboard not showing money. Maybe fixed issue with StatsDisplay stopping it's auto updates, but I could never reproduce the bug so idk.

### 1.9.7

### 1.9.1
Huge thanks to timoreo22 for doing the research for the new item descriptions. Yes a lot of them don't match the in-game description, blame Gearbox for not writing good descriptions I guess.

### 1.9.0
Quick fix for Seekers of the Storm, minor visual issues but it functions.

### 1.8.5
Fixed issue with CommandQueue (probably)

Hude thanks to Warmek and SSM240 for 99% of this update. Added a new internal calculateValuesNew alternative to calculateValues for items. Fixed descriptions of items that have no descriptions. Added cooldown/proc information for skills. Added more options for item sorting, you can now sort them in very intricate ways if you so desire. Added stage to statsdisplay.

### 1.6.1
Forgot to push option for Buff Timer size

### 1.6.0
Added Buff Definitions, hover over your buffs to see them. Buff definitions have to be pre-defined, so modded buffs need to utilize BuffDefinitions.RegisterBuff in order for their buffs to show up (this can technically be done one either side if you know the names of buffs, but it's extremely tedius with how many mods are out there). Added a few new items to StatsDisplay (maxComboThisRun, currentCombatKills, maxKillCombo, maxKillComboThisRun). Added font scale options for Item Stats. Currently thinking about a setup where you can create as many StatsDisplay tabs as you want and move them around (such as having one as a dedicated DPS meter if you wanted to), but nothing to show for it yet, look forward to it though!

### 1.5.2
Fixed a few bugs around command. Fixed a description conflict with Manuscript from mystic's items

Fixed DPS meter not resetting if you leave while it still has values stored. Fixed transforming into specific mobs like a LesserWisp causing StatsDisplay to break until restart

### 1.4.1
Fixed StatsDisplay not working with RiskUI. Added an option for how many decimal points to be used for floating point values.

### 1.4.0
Fixed a rare bug with CleanHUD. Fixed issue with scrappers and other menu's scaling (as in we don't touch them anymore since it's not needed and makes stuff look wonky and small). Fixed buff timers not showing up all the time. We actually use the setting for item counters now. Probably fixed an issue with Minimap and Refightilization (but it was inconsistent so I'll be on the lookout). Updated StatsDisplay to scale better automatically, also supports manual scaling now (thanks yuukotf2 on github!). Added an option for full item descriptions on pickup (thanks SSM240 on github!). New option to show permanent cooldown numbers for skills too. Added a secondary StatsDisplay string which, when enabled, will be used when the scoreboard is held open.
